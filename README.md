# Development Branch for MsC thesis: "Generalizing Pareto optimal policies in
multi-objective reinforcement learning

## TODO
- [] Create simple yet functional test bench
   - [x] Setup logging (via logging.DictConfig)
   - [] Setup MLFlow
   - [] Setup Hydra (seems to be the only tool actually allows to configure
     cli + configuration file easily)
   - [] Check what utilities are needed for calculating metrics (yank the code
     from morl-baselines just to ensure that they are actually correct)
   - [] Create somekind of visualization scripts

- [] Start implementing first proposed solution
   - NOTE: New variants of the solutions should be added to different branches
